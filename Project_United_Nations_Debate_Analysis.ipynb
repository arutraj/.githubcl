Every civilized nation here today is resolved\\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\\nlawless violence.\\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\\nthey threaten us all.\\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\\nmore than three hours.\\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\\nsave others.\\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\\nleaders.\\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world\\u2019s oldest\\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\\nforbids both. They dare to ask God\\u2019s blessing as they\\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\\n8\\n\\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\\nmurderer.\\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\\nfunerals of the children.\\nAnd the people of my country will remember\\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\\njustice will come.\\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder \\u2014\\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\\npotential target.\\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself \\u2014 the\\ncivilization we share \\u2014 is threatened. History will\\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\\nnation in this Hall.\\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\\nThose commitments \\u2014 hope and order, law and life \\u2014\\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\\nThe United Nations has risen to this\\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\\nfor that strong and principled stand.\\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\\nand to protect against threats.\\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\\nplan and hide.\\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\\nhelp.\\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\\nmistaken.\\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\\neventually consume them. For every regime that\\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\\nand equally accountable to justice.\\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\\n9\\n\\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul\\u2019s soccer\\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\\nmaking progress against military targets \\u2014 and that is\\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\\nburden of war.\\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\\nregime: the Taliban\\u2019s days of harbouring terrorists, and\\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\\nriddance.\\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\\ntheir country.\\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\\nUnited States will work closely with the United\\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\\npeople.\\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\\nfinancial institution in every nation.\\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\\ntogether to bring them to justice.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\\nthe United Nations.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\\nterrorists \\u2014 and to actively prevent private citizens\\nfrom providing them.\\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required \\u2014 and more\\nis expected \\u2014 of our coalition against terror. We are\\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\\nGovernment that rejects this principle \\u2014 trying to pick\\nand choose its terrorist friends \\u2014 will know the\\nconsequences.\\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\\nattacks of 11 September \\u2014 malicious lies that attempt\\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\\nadvance the cause of terror.\\n10\\n\\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\\nviolence grows.\\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\\nThe American Government also stands by its\\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\\nworking towards a day when two States \\u2014 Israel and\\nPalestine \\u2014 live peacefully together, within secure and\\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\\nwill come only when all have sworn off \\u2014 forever \\u2014\\nincitement, violence and terror.\\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\\nUnited Nations itself \\u2014 and the world needs its\\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\\nthis great institution, for example, when the\\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\\nthe world\\u2019s most persistent violators of human rights.\\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\\nauthority \\u2014 and that authority must be preserved.\\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\\nfield.\\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\\nbut our existence \\u2014 the tolerance of openness and the\\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\\nconflict is certain.\\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty \\u2014 the natural\\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\\ndignity. When men and women are released from\\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\\ngain strength for a long journey.\\nIt is our task \\u2014 the task of this generation \\u2014 to\\nprovide the response to aggression and terror. We have\\nno other choice, because there is no other peace. We\\ndid not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in\\nhistory\\u2019s call. We have a chance to write the story of\\nour times \\u2014 a story of courage defeating cruelty, and\\nlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of\\nany life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go\\nforward \\u2014 confident, determined and unafraid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"56\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2001\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We are right to aim high and\\ntake on the mightiest tasks.\\nBut as the Secretary-General has said, progress\\ndepends on working together. We need all hands on\\ndeck, pulling in the same direction. For each of us, that\\nresponsibility begins at home because the international\\ncommunity cannot help any nation that is not striving\\nto help itself.\\nEach Government has an obligation to observe\\ninternational norms on human rights, uphold the rule of\\nlaw, fight corruption and raise awareness about\\nHIV/AIDS. But in the twenty-first century, no nation\\ncan protect and serve its people simply by going it\\nalone and that is why we  all benefit from\\nstrengthening regional bodies such as the Organization\\nof American States (OAS), the Organization of African\\nUnity (OAU), the Association of South-East Asian\\nNations (ASEAN) and the Organization for Security\\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\\nBecause of their unique expertise and regional\\nlegitimacy, they can be instruments for solving some of\\nthe hardest challenges we face. But they will succeed\\nonly if we raise our expectations of these\\norganizations, call upon them to act boldly and back\\nthem when they do.\\nRegional bodies can contribute much to the\\npurposes outlined in the Charter, and the goals\\nestablished during the Millennium Summit. But here\\nagain, they cannot do it all.\\n8\\n\\nThe role of the United Nations is also vital,\\nbecause no other institution combines a comprehensive\\nmandate with near universal representation and global\\nreach.\\nWe all have an interest in the success of the\\nUnited Nations. That is its greatest strength, and also\\nits burden, because 189 nations have to work very hard\\nif they are to agree.\\nI remember when I came to New York in 1993, I\\nwas told by cynics that the United Nations was too\\nbureaucratic to change, and too big ever to achieve\\nconsensus on measures to improve its governance.\\nThose cynics were wrong. With support from\\nmany countries, we have made impressive progress.\\nCompared to seven years ago, the United Nations\\naccomplishes more and wastes less. Accountability has\\nincreased and duplication diminished.\\nThe Internal Oversight Office, which did not exist\\nin 1993, has grown steadily more rigorous and is\\nresponsible for tens of millions of dollars of savings. A\\nculture of transparency and results is slowly but surely\\ntaking hold. Moreover, both United Nations\\nHeadquarters and the entire United Nations system are\\nbetter led than they have ever been.\\nUnited Nations leaders and Members can take\\npride in the gains made, but we all know there is much\\nmore work to be done.\\nThat is why we must back the Secretary General's\\nefforts to further improve United Nations management,\\nrecognizing that every dollar wasted is a dollar lost to\\nthe fight against poverty and to the achievement of\\nother urgent goals.\\nWe must also move ahead rapidly to strengthen\\npeacekeeping, because it is the most visible and vital\\nyardstick of United Nations success and, for people in\\nstrife-torn regions, often means the difference between\\na normal life and no life at all.\\nThere is no magic formula for curing the ills that\\nhave plagued United Nations peace operations in the\\npast. But the report, just prepared by Ambassador\\nBrahimi's team, is a solid place to start.\\nAs President Clinton said last week, we need to\\nensure that United Nations peacekeepers can be\\ndeployed with the right training and equipment and the\\nright rules of engagement so they can achieve, not\\nmerely attempt, their missions.\\nThis will require a larger peacekeeping staff, on\\npermanent assignment, comprised of the best talent and\\nexperience we can find.\\nIt will require military planners the world over to\\nrecognize that training for peace operations is a\\nlegitimate part of every nation's security strategy. It\\nwill require the ability to deploy rapidly not only\\nUnited Nations military forces, but also civilian police\\nand experts in law enforcement and judicial reform. It\\nwill demand improved coordination between military\\npeacekeepers and civilian builders of peace, so that\\nmissions begun are completed and recovery bred by\\nreconciliation can take hold.\\nAnd it will require additional resources from my\\nGovernment and from each of yours. And by\\n“additional”, I mean resources that should not come at\\nthe expense of other core United Nations goals.\\nThe United States will heed the Secretary-\\nGeneral's request that we work together to consider\\nand implement the best recommendations of the\\nBrahimi report.\\nWhether for peacekeeping or programmes, the\\nUnited Nations also needs a sustainable and equitable\\nsystem of financing. We do not have that today.\\nMember States, including my own, must do a better job\\nof making payments on time. But we must also look\\nafresh at the method used to allocate responsibility for\\nUnited Nations costs.\\nLast week, the Security Council called for\\nadjustments in the scale of assessments. This plea has\\nbeen echoed by dozens of other countries and should\\nbe acted upon by the General Assembly this fall.\\nA more equitable system should provide a much\\nstronger foundation for United Nations programmes\\nand missions. It should preserve the special\\nresponsibility for peacekeeping of the Security\\nCouncil's permanent members. It should retain a\\nheavily discounted rate for the poorest countries. And\\nit should reduce the United Nations overall reliance on\\npayments from the United States, while at the same\\ntime enabling my Government to write a check to the\\nUnited Nations for nearly $600 million in prior\\nobligations.\\n9\\n\\nClearly, adjustments are long overdue. The\\nUnited Nations needs a firm and reliable financial base.\\nIn the weeks ahead, the United States will be pleased to\\nwork with members to accomplish this landmark goal.\\nFurther improvements in management and\\npeacekeeping and a sounder financial base are a vital\\nstep towards a stronger and more effective United\\nNations. But we must also stand up to the campaign\\nlaunched by Baghdad against the United Nations\\nauthority and international law.\\nSecurity Council resolution 1284 (1999) provides\\nan effective plan for protecting world security through\\nresumed weapons inspections and monitoring inside\\nIraq. It has expanded the oil-for-food programme that\\nhas delivered $8 billion in humanitarian supplies to\\nIraqi civilians, with $6 billion more on the way. And it\\nwould enable Iraq, through compliance with the\\nresolution's terms, to achieve an early suspension of\\nsanctions. Thus far, Baghdad has flatly refused to\\naccept the resolution. The regime's strategy is to ignore\\nits United Nations Charter obligations and to seek to\\npreserve at all costs its capacity to produce the\\ndeadliest weapons humanity has ever known.\\nWe must continue to do all we can to ease the\\nhardships faced by Iraq's people. But we must also\\ndefend the integrity of this institution, our security and\\ninternational law.\\nThe Millennium Summit illustrated the United\\nNations long-standing role as a forum for articulating\\nconsensus goals. But achieving these objectives will\\nrequire action at all levels, from local to global. It will\\nalso require a willingness to move well beyond the\\nlimits and habits of the past.\\nToday, the United Nations is taking on a wide\\narray of new issues, what I call “people issues”,\\nbecause they so directly affect the lives of our citizens.\\nThey include the challenge of protecting our planet by\\nlimiting greenhouse gas emissions; securing safe water\\nsupplies; halting desertification; and putting a stop to\\ntrafficking in human beings. They especially include\\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS, which was highlighted in\\na letter to the Secretary-General signed by the women\\nForeign Ministers last night. These and similar\\nchallenges are sure to be important components of\\ntwenty-first century diplomacy, and because they are\\nglobal in scope, require a global response.\\nThe United Nations is also playing an increased\\nrole in areas where cold war divisions once held it\\nback. Over the past decade, United Nations entities\\nhave contributed much by prosecuting war criminals,\\npromoting democracy, supporting human rights and\\naiding the fight against illegal drugs.\\nThese issues require a willingness to take a stand,\\nas the United Nations has done in holding accountable\\nthe perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and the\\nBalkans; striving to end rebel outrages in Sierra Leone;\\nand expressing opposition to the long-standing and\\nongoing violation of basic human rights in Burma.\\nLet me say this morning that when the Burmese\\nGovernment tries to blame the victims for the crime,\\nand say that Aung San Suu Kyi and her party are\\nresponsible for their own repression, I can only reply\\nthat much the same was once said about Gandhi and\\nMartin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Václav\\nHavel. The world is not fooled, and we must not be\\nsilent.\\nSome argue that speaking out in defence of\\nhuman rights constitutes interference in internal affairs.\\nI believe it helps to fulfil the purposes of the United\\nNations Charter, because when international norms are\\nassaulted, the United Nations must do more than\\nsimply observe injustice, or report upon it, or\\nsympathize with the victims. We must do all we can,\\nwhere we can, to stop the perpetrators.\\nThis requires the active backing and participation\\nof United Nations Members, so that respect for\\ninternational law becomes steadily more universal and\\nthe incentives for observing global standards\\nprogressively more clear.\\nThe result, if we are united and determined\\nenough, will be a world of greater security, justice and\\npeace. Realistically, this is essential, if we are to\\nachieve the ambitious social goals we have set.\\nBut there is one other essential element as well,\\nand that is democracy. This past summer in Poland, for\\nthe first time, more than 100 nations came together to\\nreaffirm democratic principles and ensure that the\\ndemocratic tide remains a rising one around the world.\\nWe did this not because democracy always\\nproduces good Governments, for it does not. But we\\nare convinced by the evidence of the old century that\\nthe hopes we share for the new will more readily be\\n10\\n\\naccomplished if people are able to live and work in\\nfreedom.\\nDemocracy is the one road we can all walk down\\ntogether and the best system yet devised for sowing\\nand growing the seeds of economic opportunity.\\nIn promoting democracy, we are not attempting to\\nimpose our values on anyone else. In fact, this is not\\npossible, because democracy, by definition, enables\\ncitizens within a country to shape their own destinies in\\naccordance with their own convictions and ideals.\\nMake no mistake. In any country, at any time,\\ndictatorship is an imposition. Democracy is a choice.\\nAs we have learned during the last 55 years, the\\nUnited Nations provides no guarantees of global peace\\nor prosperity. But it can play a vital role as catalyst and\\ncoordinator, and as a bridge connecting the\\ncontributions of one to another.\\nTo those who would judge it harshly, I would\\nrespond not by pointing first to the deliberations of\\ndiplomats such as myself, in surroundings such as\\nthese. Instead, I would point to the day-to-day efforts\\nof United Nations workers caring for refugees, feeding\\nchildren, providing shelter and preventing disease.\\nI would point to the men and women on the front\\nlines, from Port-au-Prince to Freetown, and from\\nKosovo to Kisangani, doing some of the world's\\nhardest work, and, as we have been reminded by the\\nrecent slayings of employees of the Office of the\\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in\\nEast Timor, also the most dangerous. It is their efforts\\nand sacrifice, in partnership with so many indigenous\\nand other non-governmental organizations, that truly\\nremind us of the United Nations purpose and of our\\nkinship with one another.\\nThis is, I expect, my last official speech to a\\nUnited Nations audience. As I stand before you, I am\\ndeeply conscious not only of our many\\naccomplishments, but also of the tasks not yet\\ncompleted.\\nI am grieved by the conflicts that still rage, and\\nthe basic rights and freedoms still denied. I am\\nfrustrated by the gaps that still exist between our ideals\\nand actions, and alarmed by the deepening material\\ndivide that ultimately threatens every nation, rich and\\npoor alike.\\nThere are those who say it is naïve to think that\\nthe future can be made better than the past. I am\\nreminded that this institution was founded by men and\\nwomen who were as realistic as any human beings\\ncould be, for they were the survivors of the worst\\nconflict our world has known and determined that\\nsucceeding generations should be saved from holocaust\\nand war. They had faith. Surely we, as well, must have\\nfaith that by working together within and outside this\\nOrganization, we can move together, step by step\\ntowards the lofty goals we have set, and thereby bring\\nabout a world more peaceful, prosperous and free than\\nit has ever been. Since 1993, it has been my privilege\\nto work with so many of you, from every part of the\\nglobe, in support of the interests we have in common\\nand the dreams our people share.\\nThis morning, I want to thank you for your\\nfriendship; pledge my cooperation in the months\\nimmediately ahead; and ask respectfully, in turn, for\\nyours. I promise, as well, to serve the cause of\\ninternational progress and individual liberty not only\\nfor as long as I am in office, but for as long as I am\\nalive.\""

Every civilized nation here today is resolved\\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\\nlawless violence.\\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\\nthey threaten us all.\\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\\nmore than three hours.\\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\\nsave others.\\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\\nleaders.\\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world\\u2019s oldest\\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\\nforbids both. They dare to ask God\\u2019s blessing as they\\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\\n8\\n\\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\\nmurderer.\\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\\nfunerals of the children.\\nAnd the people of my country will remember\\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\\njustice will come.\\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder \\u2014\\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\\npotential target.\\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself \\u2014 the\\ncivilization we share \\u2014 is threatened. History will\\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\\nnation in this Hall.\\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\\nThose commitments \\u2014 hope and order, law and life \\u2014\\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\\nThe United Nations has risen to this\\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\\nfor that strong and principled stand.\\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\\nand to protect against threats.\\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\\nplan and hide.\\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\\nhelp.\\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\\nmistaken.\\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\\neventually consume them. For every regime that\\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\\nand equally accountable to justice.\\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\\n9\\n\\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul\\u2019s soccer\\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\\nmaking progress against military targets \\u2014 and that is\\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\\nburden of war.\\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\\nregime: the Taliban\\u2019s days of harbouring terrorists, and\\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\\nriddance.\\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\\ntheir country.\\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\\nUnited States will work closely with the United\\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\\npeople.\\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\\nfinancial institution in every nation.\\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\\ntogether to bring them to justice.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\\nthe United Nations.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\\nterrorists \\u2014 and to actively prevent private citizens\\nfrom providing them.\\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required \\u2014 and more\\nis expected \\u2014 of our coalition against terror. We are\\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\\nGovernment that rejects this principle \\u2014 trying to pick\\nand choose its terrorist friends \\u2014 will know the\\nconsequences.\\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\\nattacks of 11 September \\u2014 malicious lies that attempt\\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\\nadvance the cause of terror.\\n10\\n\\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\\nviolence grows.\\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\\nThe American Government also stands by its\\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\\nworking towards a day when two States \\u2014 Israel and\\nPalestine \\u2014 live peacefully together, within secure and\\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\\nwill come only when all have sworn off \\u2014 forever \\u2014\\nincitement, violence and terror.\\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\\nUnited Nations itself \\u2014 and the world needs its\\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\\nthis great institution, for example, when the\\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\\nthe world\\u2019s most persistent violators of human rights.\\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\\nauthority \\u2014 and that authority must be preserved.\\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\\nfield.\\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\\nbut our existence \\u2014 the tolerance of openness and the\\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\\nconflict is certain.\\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty \\u2014 the natural\\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\\ndignity. When men and women are released from\\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\\ngain strength for a long journey.\\nIt is our task \\u2014 the task of this generation \\u2014 to\\nprovide the response to aggression and terror. We have\\nno other choice, because there is no other peace. We\\ndid not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in\\nhistory\\u2019s call. We have a chance to write the story of\\nour times \\u2014 a story of courage defeating cruelty, and\\nlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of\\nany life, and worthy of every nation.

Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We will defend ourselves and our future against terror and lawless violence. The United Nations was founded in this cause. In the Second World War, we learned that there is no isolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively and collectively, before they threaten us all. That evil has returned, and that cause is renewed. A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary General, the President of the General Assembly and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out the names of every person who died, it would take more than three hours. Those names include a citizen of the Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12 September, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week. Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed towards Mecca five times a day and who died that day trying to save others. The suffering of 11 September was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations. All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders. The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the sheikh of Al Azhar University, the world\\u2019s oldest Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that terrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy, yet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both. They dare to ask God\\u2019s blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children. But 8  the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a murderer. Time is passing. Yet for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We will remember every rescuer who died in honour. We will remember every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children. And the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us. We are learning their names. We are coming to know their faces. There is no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to protect them. However long it takes, their hour of justice will come. Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder perhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in yours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They seek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize entire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United Nations; they called our Secretary General a criminal and they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to Islam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression. Every other country is a potential target. And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience would prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that threat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself the civilization we share is threatened. History will record our response and will judge or justify every nation in this Hall. The civilized world is now responding. We act to defend ourselves and to deliver our children from a future of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death. We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos. Those commitments hope and order, law and life unite people across cultures and continents. Upon those commitments depend all peace and progress. For those commitments, we are determined to fight. The United Nations has risen to this responsibility: on 12 September, these buildings opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world, and I want to thank you, fellow members, for that strong and principled stand. I also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The authors of mass murder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith. The conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be part of every action against the enemy. But every nation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning. We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror and to protect against threats. The leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference of Governments. They need the support of a financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and plan and hide. Some nations want to play their part in the fight against terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce their laws and control their borders. We stand ready to help. Some Governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are mistaken. And some Governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast their lot with the terrorists. They support them and harbour them. And they will find that their welcomed guests are parasites that will weaken them and eventually consume them. For every regime that sponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be paid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice. The Taliban are now learning that lesson. That regime and the terrorists who support it are now virtually indistinguishable. Together they promote 9  terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people. Women are executed in Kabul\\u2019s soccer stadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are too thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings. The United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are making progress against military targets and that is our objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of the honourable conduct of the American military. And my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden of war. The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and starvation. Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United States and other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression. I make this promise to all the victims of that regime: the Taliban\\u2019s days of harbouring terrorists, and dealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing to a close. When that regime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good riddance. I can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country. Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to help Afghans through the winter. America has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of rations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban try to steal the food we send. More help, eventually, will be needed. The United States will work closely with the United Nations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. And the United States will work with the United Nations to support a post  Taliban Government that represents all of the Afghan people. In this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone. After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence. My country has been very grateful for both. The memorials and vigils around the world will not be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now passed. The time for action has now arrived. The most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the United Nations. On 28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution 1373 . Its requirements are clear: every United Nations Member has a responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of terrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every financial institution in every nation. We have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know something, tell us. If we know something, we will tell you. And when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice. We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the United Nations. We have a responsibility to deny weapons to terrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them. These obligations are urgent, and they are binding on every nation with a place in this Hall. Many Governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond resolution 1373 , more is required and more is expected of our coalition against terror. We are asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight. We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just some of them. In this world, there are good causes and bad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is drawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist. No national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any Government that rejects this principle trying to pick and choose its terrorist friends will know the consequences. We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of 11 September malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves, away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to advance the cause of terror. 10  The war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speak through violence grows. We must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land. My country is pledged to encouraging development and expanding trade. My country is pledged to investing in education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world. Following 11 September, these pledges are even more important. In our struggle against hateful groups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope. The American Government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are working towards a day when two States Israel and Palestine live peacefully together, within secure and recognized borders, as called for by the Security Council resolutions. We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations. But peace will come only when all have sworn off forever incitement, violence and terror. Finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations itself and the world needs its principled leadership. It undermines the credibility of this great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to some of the world\\u2019s most persistent violators of human rights. The United Nations depends, above all, on its moral authority and that authority must be preserved. The steps I have described will not be easy. For all nations, they will require effort. For some nations, they will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction is far greater. The only alternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field.

              "'I am honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the United States and to reinforce the eloquent message President C1inton conveyed during last week Millennium Summit. Because my father worked here when I was young, I have always considered myself a child of the United Nations. And because I had the privilege to serve here as America Permanent Representative, I feel at home and so will speak plainly. The members of this body reflect virtually every culture, ethnicity and geographical region. We are city and country, inland and island, tropical and temperate, developing and industrialized. We are as diverse as humanity. And yet, in responding to the daunting demands of this new era, we are bound together by the interests we share and the ideals to which we aspire. We all have a stake in building peace and relieving poverty, championing development and curbing disease. We all want to see the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction reduced, refugees cared for, children nourished, the environment protected, and the status of women advanced. We all believe the benefits of globalization must be allocated more broadly within and among societies. Because if the new technologies are to ease the old problems, they must help the many who today lack access and skills, so that every village becomes a home to opportunity and every school a midwife to hope. As the Millennium Summit reflected, we have no shortage of worthy goals. We are right to aim high and take on the mightiest tasks. But as the Secretary General has said, progress depends on working together. We need all hands on deck, pulling in the same direction. For each of us, that responsibility begins at home because the international community cannot help any nation that is not striving to help itself. Each Government has an obligation to observe international norms on human rights, uphold the rule of law, fight corruption and raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. But in the twenty first century, no nation can protect and serve its people simply by going it alone and that is why we  all benefit from strengthening regional bodies such as the Organization of American States , the Organization of African Unity , the Association of South East Asian Nations  and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . Because of their unique expertise and regional legitimacy, they can be instruments for solving some of the hardest challenges we face. But they will succeed only if we raise our expectations of these organizations, call upon them to act boldly and back them when they do. Regional bodies can contribute much to the purposes outlined in the Charter, and the goals established during the Millennium Summit. But here again, they cannot do it all. 8  The role of the United Nations is also vital, because no other institution combines a comprehensive mandate with near universal representation and global reach. We all have an interest in the success of the United Nations. That is its greatest strength, and also its burden, because 189 nations have to work very hard if they are to agree. I remember when I came to New York in 1993, I was told by cynics that the United Nations was too bureaucratic to change, and too big ever to achieve consensus on measures to improve its governance. Those cynics were wrong. With support from many countries, we have made impressive progress. Compared to seven years ago, the United Nations accomplishes more and wastes less. Accountability has increased and duplication diminished. The Internal Oversight Office, which did not exist in 1993, has grown steadily more rigorous and is responsible for tens of millions of dollars of savings. A culture of transparency and results is slowly but surely taking hold. Moreover, both United Nations Headquarters and the entire United Nations system are better led than they have ever been. United Nations leaders and Members can take pride in the gains made, but we all know there is much more work to be done. That is why we must back the Secretary General efforts to further improve United Nations management, recognizing that every dollar wasted is a dollar lost to the fight against poverty and to the achievement of other urgent goals. We must also move ahead rapidly to strengthen peacekeeping, because it is the most visible and vital yardstick of United Nations success and, for people in strife torn regions, often means the difference between a normal life and no life at all. There is no magic formula for curing the ills that have plagued United Nations peace operations in the past. But the report, just prepared by Ambassador Brahimi team, is a solid place to start. As President Clinton said last week, we need to ensure that United Nations peacekeepers can be deployed with the right training and equipment and the right rules of engagement so they can achieve, not merely attempt, their missions. This will require a larger peacekeeping staff, on permanent assignment, comprised of the best talent and experience we can find. It will require military planners the world over to recognize that training for peace operations is a legitimate part of every nation security strategy. It will require the ability to deploy rapidly not only United Nations military forces, but also civilian police and experts in law enforcement and judicial reform. It will demand improved coordination between military peacekeepers and civilian builders of peace, so that missions begun are completed and recovery bred by reconciliation can take hold. And it will require additional resources from my Government and from each of yours. And by “additional”, I mean resources that should not come at the expense of other core United Nations goals. The United States will heed the Secretary  General request that we work together to consider and implement the best recommendations of the Brahimi report. Whether for peacekeeping or programmes, the United Nations also needs a sustainable and equitable system of financing. We do not have that today. Member States, including my own, must do a better job of making payments on time. But we must also look afresh at the method used to allocate responsibility for United Nations costs. Last week, the Security Council called for adjustments in the scale of assessments. This plea has been echoed by dozens of other countries and should be acted upon by the General Assembly this fall. A more equitable system should provide a much stronger foundation for United Nations programmes and missions. It should preserve the special responsibility for peacekeeping of the Security Council permanent members. It should retain a heavily discounted rate for the poorest countries. And it should reduce the United Nations overall reliance on payments from the United States, while at the same time enabling my Government to write a check to the United Nations for nearly $600 million in prior obligations. 9  Clearly, adjustments are long overdue. The United Nations needs a firm and reliable financial base. In the weeks ahead, the United States will be pleased to work with members to accomplish this landmark goal. Further improvements in management and peacekeeping and a sounder financial base are a vital step towards a stronger and more effective United Nations. But we must also stand up to the campaign launched by Baghdad against the United Nations authority and international law. Security Council resolution 1284  provides an effective plan for protecting world security through resumed weapons inspections and monitoring inside Iraq. It has expanded the oil for food programme that has delivered $8 billion in humanitarian supplies to Iraqi civilians, with $6 billion more on the way. And it would enable Iraq, through compliance with the resolution terms, to achieve an early suspension of sanctions. Thus far, Baghdad has flatly refused to accept the resolution. The regime strategy is to ignore its United Nations Charter obligations and to seek to preserve at all costs its capacity to produce the deadliest weapons humanity has ever known. We must continue to do all we can to ease the hardships faced by Iraq people. But we must also defend the integrity of this institution, our security and international law. The Millennium Summit illustrated the United Nations long standing role as a forum for articulating consensus goals. But achieving these objectives will require action at all levels, from local to global. It will also require a willingness to move well beyond the limits and habits of the past. Today, the United Nations is taking on a wide array of new issues, what I call “people issues”, because they so directly affect the lives of our citizens. They include the challenge of protecting our planet by limiting greenhouse gas emissions; securing safe water supplies; halting desertification; and putting a stop to trafficking in human beings. They especially include the fight against HIV/AIDS, which was highlighted in a letter to the Secretary General signed by the women Foreign Ministers last night. These and similar challenges are sure to be important components of twenty first century diplomacy, and because they are global in scope, require a global response. The United Nations is also playing an increased role in areas where cold war divisions once held it back. Over the past decade, United Nations entities have contributed much by prosecuting war criminals, promoting democracy, supporting human rights and aiding the fight against illegal drugs. These issues require a willingness to take a stand, as the United Nations has done in holding accountable the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and the Balkans; striving to end rebel outrages in Sierra Leone; and expressing opposition to the long standing and ongoing violation of basic human rights in Burma. Let me say this morning that when the Burmese Government tries to blame the victims for the crime, and say that Aung San Suu Kyi and her party are responsible for their own repression, I can only reply that much the same was once said about Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Václav Havel. The world is not fooled, and we must not be silent. Some argue that speaking out in defence of human rights constitutes interference in internal affairs. I believe it helps to fulfil the purposes of the United Nations Charter, because when international norms are assaulted, the United Nations must do more than simply observe injustice, or report upon it, or sympathize with the victims. We must do all we can, where we can, to stop the perpetrators. This requires the active backing and participation of United Nations Members, so that respect for international law becomes steadily more universal and the incentives for observing global standards progressively more clear. The result, if we are united and determined enough, will be a world of greater security, justice and peace. Realistically, this is essential, if we are to achieve the ambitious social goals we have set. But there is one other essential element as well, and that is democracy. This past summer in Poland, for the first time, more than 100 nations came together to reaffirm democratic principles and ensure that the democratic tide remains a rising one around the world. We did this not because democracy always produces good Governments, for it does not. But we are convinced by the evidence of the old century that the hopes we share for the new will more readily be 10  accomplished if people are able to live and work in freedom. Democracy is the one road we can all walk down together and the best system yet devised for sowing and growing the seeds of economic opportunity. In promoting democracy, we are not attempting to impose our values on anyone else. In fact, this is not possible, because democracy, by definition, enables citizens within a country to shape their own destinies in accordance with their own convictions and ideals. Make no mistake. In any country, at any time, dictatorship is an imposition. Democracy is a choice. As we have learned during the last 55 years, the United Nations provides no guarantees of global peace or prosperity. But it can play a vital role as catalyst and coordinator, and as a bridge connecting the contributions of one to another. To those who would judge it harshly, I would respond not by pointing first to the deliberations of diplomats such as myself, in surroundings such as these. Instead, I would point to the day to day efforts of United Nations workers caring for refugees, feeding children, providing shelter and preventing disease. I would point to the men and women on the front lines, from Port au Prince to Freetown, and from Kosovo to Kisangani, doing some of the world hardest work, and, as we have been reminded by the recent slayings of employees of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in East Timor, also the most dangerous. It is their efforts and sacrifice, in partnership with so many indigenous and other non governmental organizations, that truly remind us of the United Nations purpose and of our kinship with one another. This is, I expect, my last official speech to a United Nations audience. As I stand before you, I am deeply conscious not only of our many accomplishments, but also of the tasks not yet completed. I am grieved by the conflicts that still rage, and the basic rights and freedoms still denied. I am frustrated by the gaps that still exist between our ideals and actions, and alarmed by the deepening material divide that ultimately threatens every nation, rich and poor alike. There are those who say it is naïve to think that the future can be made better than the past. I am reminded that this institution was founded by men and women who were as realistic as any human beings could be, for they were the survivors of the worst conflict our world has known and determined that succeeding generations should be saved from holocaust and war. They had faith. Surely we, as well, must have faith that by working together within and outside this Organization, we can move together, step by step towards the lofty goals we have set, and thereby bring about a world more peaceful, prosperous and free than it has ever been. Since 1993, it has been my privilege to work with so many of you, from every part of the globe, in support of the interests we have in common and the dreams our people share. This morning, I want to thank you for your friendship; pledge my cooperation in the months immediately ahead; and ask respectfully, in turn, for yours. I promise, as well, to serve the cause of international progress and individual liberty not only for as long as I am in office, but for as long as I am alive.'"

Every civilized nation here today is resolved\\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\\nlawless violence.\\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\\nthey threaten us all.\\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\\nmore than three hours.\\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\\nsave others.\\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\\nleaders.\\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world\\u2019s oldest\\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\\nforbids both. They dare to ask God\\u2019s blessing as they\\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\\n8\\n\\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\\nmurderer.\\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\\nfunerals of the children.\\nAnd the people of my country will remember\\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\\njustice will come.\\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder \\u2014\\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\\npotential target.\\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself \\u2014 the\\ncivilization we share \\u2014 is threatened. History will\\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\\nnation in this Hall.\\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\\nThose commitments \\u2014 hope and order, law and life \\u2014\\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\\nThe United Nations has risen to this\\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\\nfor that strong and principled stand.\\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\\nand to protect against threats.\\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\\nplan and hide.\\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\\nhelp.\\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\\nmistaken.\\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\\neventually consume them. For every regime that\\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\\nand equally accountable to justice.\\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\\n9\\n\\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul\\u2019s soccer\\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\\nmaking progress against military targets \\u2014 and that is\\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\\nburden of war.\\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\\nregime: the Taliban\\u2019s days of harbouring terrorists, and\\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\\nriddance.\\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\\ntheir country.\\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\\nUnited States will work closely with the United\\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\\npeople.\\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\\nfinancial institution in every nation.\\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\\ntogether to bring them to justice.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\\nthe United Nations.\\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\\nterrorists \\u2014 and to actively prevent private citizens\\nfrom providing them.\\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required \\u2014 and more\\nis expected \\u2014 of our coalition against terror. We are\\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\\nGovernment that rejects this principle \\u2014 trying to pick\\nand choose its terrorist friends \\u2014 will know the\\nconsequences.\\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\\nattacks of 11 September \\u2014 malicious lies that attempt\\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\\nadvance the cause of terror.\\n10\\n\\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\\nviolence grows.\\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\\nThe American Government also stands by its\\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\\nworking towards a day when two States \\u2014 Israel and\\nPalestine \\u2014 live peacefully together, within secure and\\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\\nwill come only when all have sworn off \\u2014 forever \\u2014\\nincitement, violence and terror.\\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\\nUnited Nations itself \\u2014 and the world needs its\\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\\nthis great institution, for example, when the\\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\\nthe world\\u2019s most persistent violators of human rights.\\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\\nauthority \\u2014 and that authority must be preserved.\\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\\nfield.\\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\\nbut our existence \\u2014 the tolerance of openness and the\\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\\nconflict is certain.\\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty \\u2014 the natural\\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\\ndignity. When men and women are released from\\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\\ngain strength for a long journey.\\nIt is our task \\u2014 the task of this generation \\u2014 to\\nprovide the response to aggression and terror.

Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We will defend ourselves and our future against terror and lawless violence. The United Nations was founded in this cause. In the Second World War, we learned that there is no isolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively and collectively, before they threaten us all. That evil has returned, and that cause is renewed. A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary General, the President of the General Assembly and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out the names of every person who died, it would take more than three hours. Those names include a citizen of the Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12 September, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week. Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed towards Mecca five times a day and who died that day trying to save others. The suffering of 11 September was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations. All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders. The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the sheikh of Al Azhar University, the world\\u2019s oldest Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that terrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy, yet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both. They dare to ask God\\u2019s blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children. But 8  the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a murderer. Time is passing. Yet for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We will remember every rescuer who died in honour. We will remember every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children. And the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us. We are learning their names. We are coming to know their faces. There is no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to protect them. However long it takes, their hour of justice will come. Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder perhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in yours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They seek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize entire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United Nations; they called our Secretary General a criminal and they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to Islam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression. Every other country is a potential target. And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience would prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that threat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself the civilization we share is threatened. History will record our response and will judge or justify every nation in this Hall. The civilized world is now responding. We act to defend ourselves and to deliver our children from a future of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death. We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos. Those commitments hope and order, law and life unite people across cultures and continents. Upon those commitments depend all peace and progress. For those commitments, we are determined to fight. The United Nations has risen to this responsibility: on 12 September, these buildings opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world, and I want to thank you, fellow members, for that strong and principled stand. I also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The authors of mass murder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith. The conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be part of every action against the enemy. But every nation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning. We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror and to protect against threats. The leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference of Governments. They need the support of a financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and plan and hide. Some nations want to play their part in the fight against terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce their laws and control their borders. We stand ready to help. Some Governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are mistaken. And some Governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast their lot with the terrorists. They support them and harbour them. And they will find that their welcomed guests are parasites that will weaken them and eventually consume them. For every regime that sponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be paid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice. The Taliban are now learning that lesson. That regime and the terrorists who support it are now virtually indistinguishable. Together they promote 9  terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people. Women are executed in Kabul\\u2019s soccer stadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are too thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings. The United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are making progress against military targets and that is our objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of the honourable conduct of the American military. And my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden of war. The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and starvation. Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United States and other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression. I make this promise to all the victims of that regime: the Taliban\\u2019s days of harbouring terrorists, and dealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing to a close. When that regime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good riddance. I can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country. Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to help Afghans through the winter. America has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of rations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban try to steal the food we send. More help, eventually, will be needed. The United States will work closely with the United Nations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. And the United States will work with the United Nations to support a post  Taliban Government that represents all of the Afghan people. In this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone. After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence. My country has been very grateful for both. The memorials and vigils around the world will not be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now passed. The time for action has now arrived. The most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the United Nations. On 28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution 1373 . Its requirements are clear: every United Nations Member has a responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of terrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every financial institution in every nation. We have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know something, tell us. If we know something, we will tell you. And when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice. We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the United Nations. We have a responsibility to deny weapons to terrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them. These obligations are urgent, and they are binding on every nation with a place in this Hall. Many Governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond resolution 1373 , more is required and more is expected of our coalition against terror. We are asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight. We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just some of them. In this world, there are good causes and bad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is drawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist. No national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any Government that rejects this principle trying to pick and choose its terrorist friends will know the consequences. We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of 11 September malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves, away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to advance the cause of terror. 10  The war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speak through violence grows. We must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land. My country is pledged to encouraging development and expanding trade. My country is pledged to investing in education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world. Following 11 September, these pledges are even more important. In our struggle against hateful groups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope. The American Government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are working towards a day when two States Israel and Palestine live peacefully together, within secure and recognized borders, as called for by the Security Council resolutions. We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations. But peace will come only when all have sworn off forever incitement, violence and terror. Finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations itself and the world needs its principled leadership. It undermines the credibility of this great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to some of the world\\u2019s most persistent violators of human rights. The United Nations depends, above all, on its moral authority and that authority must be preserved. The steps I have described will not be easy. For all nations, they will require effort. For some nations, they will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction is far greater. The only alternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field. As I told the American people, freedom and fear are at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies, but our existence the tolerance of openness and the creative culture that define us. But the outcome of this conflict is certain. There is a current in history, and it runs towards freedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined by liberty the natural right to create, and build, and worship, and live in dignity. When men and women are released from oppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope, and they leave poverty by the millions. These aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the Islamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied. We are confident, too, that history has an author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know that evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is the teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we gain strength for a long journey. It is our task the task of this generation to provide the response to aggression and terror. We have no other choice, because there is no other peace. We did not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in history\\u2019s call. We have a chance to write the story of our times a story of courage defeating cruelty, and light overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go forward confident, determined and unafraid.    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
